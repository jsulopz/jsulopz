### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am [@jsulopz](https://twitter.com/jsulopz), a Python + Data Science Trainer & Consultant.

I share everything I know about Python + Data Science through my `tutorials`:

How did I end up teaching Online Lessons to people from all over the world?

Since 2017, I acknoledge [my gambling addiction](https://medium.com/@jesusloplar/buenas-tardes-me-llamo-jes%C3%BAs-l%C3%B3pez-enfermo-lud%C3%B3pata-en-rehabilitaci%C3%B3n-7566c17ee56) with online sports and started my recovery process.

I didn't have any money and I had to earn it to sustain myself in University (my parents also helped, 70% of the budget).

What could I do with what I had?

- Teaching maths, physics & whatsoever to High School kids in Salamanca.

One and a half year later, my friend Sara asked me to teach her R. We did a lesson and she told me she loved the way I had taught her.

Therefore, I put an [online advertisement](https://www.tusclasesparticulares.com/profesores/jesus-lopez1407633/opiniones) to teach R programming.

A guy from Madrid asked me for a lesson, but I thought it was impossible because I was in another city. We did it online via skype. And I changed the online advertisement for online mode.

Since then, I have given more than 4,000h of private lessons to more than [400 people](https://github.com/jsulopz/01-resolving-python-data-science/network/members) of any kind.

The most high-level profiles I've given lessons to are bankers from & researchers from Harvard & Oxford Universities.
