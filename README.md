### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am [@jsulopz](https://twitter.com/jsulopz), a Python + Data Science Trainer & Consultant.

I coach people to develop the [Resolving Discipline](https://github.com/jsulopz/00-python-resolver-discipline) that turns them into independent programmers.

You can see my `tutorials` via:

2. [Python Assembly Blog](https://blog.pythonassembly.com/)

How did I end up teaching Online Lessons to people from all over the world (including Doctors from Harvard & Oxford Universities)?

On January 17th of 2017, I acknowledged [my gambling addiction](https://medium.com/@jesusloplar/buenas-tardes-me-llamo-jes%C3%BAs-l%C3%B3pez-enfermo-lud%C3%B3pata-en-rehabilitaci%C3%B3n-7566c17ee56) to online sports and started my recovery.

I didn't have any money, and I had to earn it to sustain myself in University (my parents helped 70% of the budget, but lost most of it to gambling).

What could I do with what I had?

Teach maths, physics & whatsoever to High School kids in Salamanca.

One and a half years later, my friend Sara asked me to teach her R. We did a lesson, and she told me she loved the way I had taught her.

Therefore, I put an [online advertisement](https://www.tusclasesparticulares.com/profesores/jesus-lopez1407633/opiniones) to teach R programming.

In October 2019, a guy from Madrid asked me for a lesson, but I thought it was impossible because I was in another city. So we did it online via skype.

I changed the online advertisement to give Online Private Lessons. It changed my life.

Since then, I have given more than 4,000h of private lessons to more than [400 people](https://github.com/jsulopz/01-resolving-python-data-science/network/members) of any kind.

- 70% of them needed my help to solve their Course assignments
- 30% of them wanted to learn Data Science + Python from scratch

At some point in the summer of 2020, I discovered that I was teaching the same topics over and over again. Therefore I decided to structure the materials in the following courses:

1. [Resolving Python with Data Science](https://github.com/jsulopz/01-resolving-python-data-science)
2. [Machine Learning](https://github.com/jsulopz/02-machine-learning)

Nowadays, I dedicate at least 40h per week to teach my students and create educational content for my online channels.

If you want me to train you in the field of Data Science + Python, you can book a lesson [here â†—](https://resolvingpython.as.me/)
